		Oozes love Flamenco.  Don't ask.
		I personally prefer some non-ancestral right-the-heck-now healing, but maybe that is just me.
		You could summon Misha, Leokk, or Huffer!  Huffer is more trouble than he's worth.
		This spell is much better than Arcane Implosion.
		Playing this card makes you SMARTER.  And let's face it: we could all stand to be a little smarter.
		You'd think you'd be able to control your missiles a little better since you're a powerful mage and all.
		Magi conjured arcane arrows to sell to hunters, until hunters learned just enough magic to do it themselves.  The resulting loss of jobs sent Stormwind into a minor recession.
		No… actually you should fear the Reaper.
		You earn the title of Archmage when you can destroy anyone who calls you on it.
		Guaranteed to have been owned by a real assassin.   Certificate of authenticity included.
		If you don't want to be assassinated, move to the Barrens and change your name. Good luck!
		It's funny how often yelling "Look over there!" gets your opponent to turn around.
		Given the number of kings who have been assassinated, are you sure you want their blessing?

		You don't see a lot of Dalaran warriors.
		Healing is just something she does in her free time.  It's more of a hobby really.
		Rogues guard the secrets to poison-making carefully, lest magi start incorporating poison into their spells.  Poisonbolt? Rain of Poison?  Poison Elemental?  Nobody wants that.

		Totemsmiths like to use the rarest woods for their totems.  There are even rumors of totems made of Ironbark Protectors.
		Hey man, that's cold.  Literally and metaphorically.
		FROST SHOCK!
		It is customary to yell "Chill out!" or "Freeze!" or "Ice ice, baby!" when you play this card.
		Grunting is what his father did and his father before that.   It's more than just a job.
		The Frostwolves are locked in combat with the Stormpike Expedition over control of Alterac Valley.  Every attempt at peace-talks has ended with Captain Galvangar killing the mediator.
		She's never quite sure what she's making, she just knows it's AWESOME!
		If 1/2 minions are all that is defending Goldshire, you would think it would have been overrun years ago.
		These are the brainy murlocs.  It turns out that doesn’t mean much.
		Holy beings from the beyond are so cliché!
		No Pain, No Gain.
		A good paladin has many tools.  Hammer of Wrath, Pliers of Vengeance, Hacksaw of Justice, etc.
		This spell has been renamed so many times, even paladins don’t know what it should be called anymore.
		8 Health, no waiting.
		It's spells like these that make it hard for Warlocks to get decent help.
		Really, if you're a hero, this is <i>every</i> strike.
		If you Hex a Murloc... it really isn't much of a change, is it?
		If you are often bathed in Holy Light, you should consider wearing sunscreen.
		If the Holy Light forsakes you, good luck casting this spell.  Also, you're probably a jerk.

		The Kor'kron are the elite forces of Garrosh Hellscream. Let's just say you don't want to run into these guys while wearing a blue tabard.
		Prince Malchezaar was a collector of rare weapons. He'd animate them and have them dance for him.
		He used to be a 2100+ rated arena player, but that was years ago and nobody can get him to shut up about it.
		He likes to think he is powerful, but pretty much anyone can solo Molten Core now.
		Not to be confused with Jim of the Wild.
		This spell blasts you directly in the MIND.
		Nominated as "Spell Most Likely to Make Your Opponent Punch the Wall."

		No relation to "The Voidsteppers", the popular Void-based dance troupe.
		Voodoo is an oft-misunderstood art. But it <i>is</i> art.
		Golems are not afraid, but for some reason they still run when you cast Fear on them.  Instinct, maybe?  A desire to blend in?
